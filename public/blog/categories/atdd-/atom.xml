    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/bramhaghosh">Bramha Ghosh</a> and I were honored to speak at the Test Automation Bazaar, otherwise known as "Watir Bazaar", on March 24-25.</p>

<p>We presented our journey in implementing Specification by Example in a mid-size enterprise environment at Grange Insurance
in Columbus, OH.  We covered things such as what our environment was like previously, how we were able to convince management
to try Acceptance Test Driven Development, how our team reacted, things that worked and how we plan to move forward.</p>

<p>It was amazing to be surrounded by so many passionate developers and testers! Even though Watir is used at many places such
as Facebook, GAP, and Expedia, it's still got a small home grown feel.  The conference was small but everyone there had a voice
into how Watir would progress into the future.  After all, it is an open source project!</p>

<p>All of the conference sessions were recorded and you may find them <a href="http://kondoot.com/watir">here</a>.</p>
